Create fluid typography & spacing presets natively in Elementor — no CSS clamp formulas, no breakpoints, just seamless responsive design.

== Description ==

**Design once. Scale everywhere.**

Fluid Design System for Elementor is a small yet powerful add-on that brings fluid typography and spacing presets directly into Elementor's interface — helping you create fully responsive designs that scale naturally across every screen size, from tiny phones to ultra-wide desktops.

🎯 *Think of it like color presets — but for padding, font sizes, and layout gaps.*

With just a few clicks, you can:
- Define minimum and maximum values for typography or spacing.
- Apply those values using a new "fluid" unit inside any Elementor control.
- Watch your design scale smoothly—no coding or media queries required.

Say goodbye to manually tweaking every breakpoint. Say hello to automatic, intelligent design scaling.

== How It Works ==

❓ **What Does "Fluid" Mean?**

Traditionally in Elementor, you need to set separate values for each breakpoint — for example, one font size for desktop, another for tablet, and another for mobile.

While this gives some control, it has two major downsides:
- 🧩 **It's rigid**: You only define styles for specific screen widths, leaving awkward gaps in between where the design may not scale smoothly.
- ⏱️ **It's time-consuming**: Updating styles across multiple breakpoints for every section and element becomes a repetitive, manual process.

💡 **Fluid Design System solves this.**
Instead of setting fixed values for each breakpoint, you define just two—a minimum and a maximum — and the plugin automatically generates a smooth scaling behavior in between. This means:
- One preset handles all screen sizes.
- You get consistent design and spacing across the entire site.
- You save time and reduce manual effort.

This plugin introduces **Fluid Units**, powered by CSS `clamp()` and custom presets, allowing your design to scale automatically across all screen sizes.

Here's how it works in real scenarios:

### ✍️ Fluid Typography Example
- Old way: 24px (mobile), 36px (tablet), 72px (desktop)
- Fluid way: One preset: min = 24px, max = 72px
- Result: Text scales smoothly and proportionally on all devices.

### 📦 Fluid Spacing Example
- Old way: 40px (mobile), 80px (tablet), 160px (desktop)
- Fluid way: One preset: min = 40px, max = 160px
- Result: Section padding adjusts naturally without breakpoints.

### 🔗 Fluid Gaps Example
- Gap between elements: 20px (mobile) to 60px (desktop)
- Result: Even spacing between containers and widgets on any screen.

❓ **Why not Just Use `vw` or `vh` Units?**

While viewport units like `vw` can scale elements based on screen width, they often lack control — your text might become unreadably small or overly large. The Fluid Design System solves this by generating `clamp()` values behind the scenes, so your designs stay within defined min/max boundaries. This gives you the flexibility of responsive scaling, combined with the precision of design tokens.

👉 Behind the scenes, the plugin creates CSS variables like: `clamp(24px, 5vw, 72px)` which Elementor then uses across typography, spacing, padding, margin, and more.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin from the Plugins screen in WordPress.
2. Make sure Elementor plugin is installed and activated
3. Go to Elementor Editor > Site Settings > Fluid Typography & Spacing to create your presets
4. Select "fluid" unit in Elementor controls to use your presets
5. Once applied, your designs will fluidly scale across all screen sizes!

== How to Use ==

Follow these steps to set up and use the Fluid Design System in your Elementor projects.

= 📐 Step 1: Configure Fluid Breakpoints =

1. Go to Elementor > Site Settings
2. Navigate to the "Fluid Typography & Spacing" tab
3. In the "Breakpoints" panel, set your:
   - Minimum Screen Width (e.g., 360px for mobile)
   - Maximum Screen Width (e.g., 1920px for desktop)

= 🧰 Step 2: Create Your Presets =

1. In the same "Fluid Typography & Spacing" tab:
   - Go to "Typography Presets" to create fluid font size presets
   - Go to "Spacing Presets" to create fluid spacing presets
2. For each preset:
   - Give it a descriptive name
   - Set minimum and maximum values
   - Optionally set custom breakpoints for this preset

= 🎨 Step 3: Apply Your Presets =

1. Edit any page with Elementor
2. In any control that supports custom units (typography, spacing, etc.):
   - Select "fluid" as the unit
   - Choose your preset from the dropdown
3. Watch your design smoothly adapt to different screen sizes

= 🔧 Step 4: Fine-tune Your Design =

1. Use the live preview to see how your presets work
2. Adjust preset values if needed
3. Create additional presets for different design needs

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to know CSS to use this plugin? =

No coding or CSS knowledge required. Everything is managed through Elementor's familiar interface.

= Will this work with my Elementor widgets? =

Yes! The fluid units are available in any Elementor control that supports "custom" units, including typography, spacing, paddings, margins, gaps and more.

= Will this work with my current theme? =

Yes! The plugin works with any WordPress theme, including the default Hello theme by Elementor.

= Will this slow down my website? =

No! The plugin uses Elementor's native CSS generation system, ensuring optimal performance. The fluid calculations are done once during CSS generation, not during page load.

= How is this different from using viewport units like `vw` or `vh`? =

Viewport units (like `vw`) scale based on the entire screen width, but they have no upper or lower limit — which can lead to text or spacing being too small on mobile or too large on desktops. Fluid units in this plugin use CSS `clamp()` behind the scenes, which means you define a minimum and maximum value. The result scales smoothly between those values — giving you precise, predictable, and accessible designs across all screen sizes.

= Can I use different units (px, em, rem) in my presets? =

Yes! You can mix different units in your presets, like using "3em" as a minimum value and "160px" as a maximum value.

= Can I use custom breakpoints for different presets? =

Yes! You can set global breakpoints or define custom breakpoints for each individual preset. The default values (360px to 1920px) are just suggestions - you can set any values that work best for your design.

= What browsers are supported? =

The plugin uses the CSS `clamp()` function, which is supported by all modern browsers, including:
- Chrome 79+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13.4+
- Edge 79+
- Opera 66+
- iOS Safari 13.4+
- Android Chrome 79+
